# Bash Wizard

## TODO

* Make score be dependent on position in the top N suggestions, maybe scalled by index?
* Weird history issues between windows
* Make context look at first N letters instead of full commands, or maybe ignore stuff in quotes?
* Change name to `Historian` (or something else)?
* Write README.
* Write blog post and make video.
